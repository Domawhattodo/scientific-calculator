# calculator

This calculator was inspired by the Windows 10 Scientific Calculator with the fold-out history view. This view appears when you expand the Windows 10 calculator horizontally. I wanted a skeumorphic design so I made the calculator window tall and added 4 lines of history at the bottom.
